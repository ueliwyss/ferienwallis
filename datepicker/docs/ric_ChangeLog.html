version 1.0.7 (November 15, 2007)

    -   fixed a bug where on some installations, months could not be changed
    -   fixed a bug where where selectableDatesRange couldn't be used without also
        using selectableYearsRange (thanks to Robert Hirn for reporting)
    -   the datepicker now pops-up in the center of the screen
    -   a new property was added &quot;showGoToCurrentMonthYear&quot; which, when set to TRUE,
        will show another button that when clicked sends the datepicker back to
        current month/year

version 1.0.6 (May 12, 2007)

    -   times could not be changed in Firefox
    -   times could not be preselected
    -   added spanish translation (thanks to Nacho Diaz Asenjo)

version 1.0.5 (February 12, 2007)

    -   preselected date was highlighted but not actually preselected
        (thanks to Chad Voelker for reporting)
    -   selected date/time was not preserved if month/year was changed
    -   using any date format other than the default, would cause all dates to be
        disabled everywhere (thanks to Donna Robinson)
    -   a potential problem with selectableYearsRange and selectableTimesRange was
        fixed. the cause of the problem was the fact that PHP's date() function
        (that users might rely on for setting these ranges) returns a string and
        therefore date(&quot;Y&quot;) would return the current date as a string rather than
        an integer (which made the calendar unusable). (thanks to Donna Robinson)

version 1.0.4 (January 27, 2007)

    -   new property added: selectableYearsRange. setting values to this
        property will make the years show in a select box (rather than static
        text) enabling the user to quickly select a year from given ranges
    -   new property added: enableTimePicker. setting this to TRUE will let
        users to also select hours/minutes
    -   new property added: selectableTimesRange. available only if
        enableTimePickersetting is set to TRUE. setting values to this
        property will let the users select hours/minutes only from given ranges
    -   fixed a bug that prevented preselection of a date
    -   added finnish language translation (thanks to Tomi Kivinen)
    -   many optimizations both to the PHP code and to the HTML template file.
        drastically reduced the generated HTML output with a tweak to the
        XTemplate templating engine (muhahahaha)
    -   the default template is now valid HTML 4.01 Transitional and XHTML 1.0
    -   lots of examples added
    *   property selectableRange is no longer available. it's equivalent is
        selectableDatesRange. setting values to this property will let the users
        select dates only from given ranges
    *   property showClearDate is no longer available

version 1.0.3 (November 03, 2006)

    -   fixed major security issue where an attacker could include
        random scripts (thanks to tobozo)
    -   if the datepicker was called with the onclick event of an
        &quot;image&quot; input type from a form, the form got submitted
    -   added romanian language translation
    -   added slovenian language translation (thanks to Damjan Leban)

version 1.0.2 (October 11, 2006)

    -   you can now set specific date ranges from where the user can
        pick a date thus restricting him from choosing wrong dates
        (see the manual for the new selectableRange property)
    -   added italian language translation (thanks to Raffaele Turra)
    -   added french language translation (thanks to Youri Lacan-Bartley)
    
version 1.0.1 (September 04, 2006)

    -   the datePicker now pops up as a modal window (it will stay on top of
        other windows until closed) and will also have the focus by default
        (thanks Johan van Ieperen)
    -   added the possibility to define for each language how the abbreviations
        for names of months and days should be (thanks Johan van Ieperen)
    -   the manual was confusing about how to use another language file
    -   fixed a bug that would scramble up days on months where first day of the
        week was on a Sunday
    -   added german language translation (thanks to Wassilios Meletiadis)
    -   added dutch language translation (thanks to Johan van Ieperen)
